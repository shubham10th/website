</body><h2>ABOUT DBSE</h2>
<p>Most assessment systems evaluate students solely based on a semester-end, marks-based examination. This puts a lot of emphasis on learning by rote and memorizing textbooks. It also has very strict rules about which subjects can be studied and how exams are set up. High-stakes board exams have become a source of extreme stress for many students, also adversely impacting their wellbeing.<hr>
 

about
There is barely any focus on making assessment a regular part of the teaching-learning experience and using assessments as tools for learning rather than solely to evaluate student progress. Carefully designed assessments can help students improve their practical, creative, analytical, and problem-solving skills. <br><hr>
With this context in place, the Government of NCT of Delhi launched the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE). The DBSE advocates for a new assessment system that enables students' holistic development. It aims to shift the focus of assessment and prepare students for future challenges in a stress-free environment. Supplemented with the cutting-edge curricula of Ambedkar SOSE , students will be prepared to pursue higher education in premier institutions as well as the new-age employment opportunities of the 21st century.<a href="https://www.edudel.nic.in/sose/static/media/MoE_%20LIST%20OF%20RECOGNISED%20BOARDS.7ff6d43c2de893e4b335.pdf" target="_main"> visit accrediation</a> <hr>
